# Wide Foot for V0.2

This is a wider foot designed for the Voron V0.2. While working through the Ender 3 V2 Switchwire conversion I found I really liked the feet that were included so I designed a smaller set to be printed out of TPU.

Use an M3 washer and a M3X12 BSCS to attach foot in place of stock feet.
